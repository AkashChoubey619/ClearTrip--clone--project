  {title:'Good Basic hotel',rating:4, name:'anita3695 on Oct 21, 23',comment:'The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was basic but okay for me as l prefer no frills. There are restaurants nearby so easy to get dinner. The hotel is near the airport but roads can be very busy at peak times.'},
  {title:'Good Basic hotel',rating:3.5, name:'saurav001 on jul 14, 23',comment:`Small & clean rooms. Rooms has no window. Breakfast spread not huge but tasty. They don't have room service and in house kitchen to serve lunch/dinner/anything. No tea/coffee maker in room. There is dispense for tea/coffee in 4th floor people can use that. For any food requirement you have to depend on Swiggy/Zomato also they dont deliver it to room and not provide cutlery to have food at your room with ease. Which I feel very inconvenient`},
  {title:'Good Basic hotel',rating:1, name:'deepak01 on jun 21, 23',comment:`Not worth the price at all. Overpriced. Small rooms, Worst service did not give towels for entire day. did not change room on requeast. Staff ignores you. Room with toilet view instead of city view. Go only if you get delux room for 2000. otherwise don't go only. Worst service. Breakfast ok only.`},
  {title:'Good Basic hotel',rating:5, name:'subline11 on Mar 11, 23',comment: `Hotel is close to the Airport. Absolute Value for Money. It's a small Business/ Transit Hotel Room was of a decent size. It also had an Extra Bed. Sheets clean. AC working Well. It's not a resort type of Hotel. Not a 'Fun' place with amenities. But excellent for Overnight stay. Ventilation can be a small issue; but it didn't matter in my short stay. Breakfast was regular. Would recommend for basic short Stay for low prices`},
